## Missing Persons in the United States
This project is from Data Science I course. It is about "Missing Persons in the United States".

## Introduction

In this project we are focusing on the missing persons data for the United States. Our data is derived from NamUS' public data software. This missing persons' data is specifically for the United States. In this data we explore the number of people that are missing in the U. S, their ages, race/ethnicity, states, and counties. The reason we chose to look at this data is because there is a growing number of missing persons in America by the year, and we feel that it is an issue that deserves more attention (not only from the media but also from authorities). In fact, Statista.com report that, as of 2018, over 600,000 people are recorded missing yearly. A missing person can be defined as a person who may go missing due to an accident, death in a location where the body cannot be found, crime, a voluntary disappearance, or for other reasons unknown to the public. The reasons for going lost are numerous and shifted and can incorporate mental illness, accidents, household violence, and being a casualty of crime.
